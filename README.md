# Connect4-AI

Developed a Connect 4 AI with alpha beta pruning and expectimax function

requires tkinter and numpy packages

Type: 
"python3 ConnectFour.py --time [number_of_seconds] [{human, ai, random}] [{human, ai, random}]"

If human player moves are entered through terminal. You can also change the maximum search depth that the AI can traverse, default is 4. The higher search depth will mean that the AI's
turns will be longer, hence we have a paramter for the time limit for you and the AI.
